As we've said in the class efficiency is a pivotal component of statistical computing (and data science). In this essay, give an explanation of what that term "efficiency" means in relation to statistical computing and describe some places where you encountered efficiency and understood its importance. Include: What is the definition of "efficiency"? What does efficiency look like in statistical computing / data science? What does efficiency allow you to do? Why is efficiency important? Where did you encounter efficiency, and what were some ["a-ha" moments](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aha%20moment) you had about efficiency? (For the latter, tie each a-ha moment to an artifact in the portfolio.)\

The term efficiency refers the how quick/how energy saving it was to complete a task. Efficiency in statistical computing is the ability to write concise and nonrepeated code that does the job well. It would also utilize the most modern tools. Efficiency allows you to save time computing and most of the time allows other users to understand your code easier. Efficiency is important because when you work in industry on a database of millions of entries, every milisecond you can save parsing each entry can decrease the program run time by even days
